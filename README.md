# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction 

This repository contains the code and workflow for a machine learning project that predicts passenger survival in the Titanic disaster using historical data. The project uses **Logistic Regression** to model survival outcomes based on various passenger features.

---

## 📝 Description

This project is based on the well-known [Kaggle Titanic dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), and aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic tragedy based on features such as:

- Age  
- Gender  
- Passenger Class (Pclass)  
- Fare  
- Family Size  

The notebook follows a typical machine learning pipeline including **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, and **evaluation**.

The implementation is done using **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook**, with the help of:

- **Pandas, NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for model development and evaluation

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**  
   Import the dataset and inspect its structure.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualize key trends and survival distributions using plots and group summaries.

3. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handle missing values (e.g., `Age`, `Embarked`) and convert categorical variables into numeric format.

4. **Feature Engineering**  
   Create additional meaningful features such as:  
   - `FamilySize`  
   - `IsAlone`  
   - `Title` (extracted from passenger names)

5. **Modeling**  
   Train a **Logistic Regression** model for binary classification of survival.

6. **Evaluation**  
   Evaluate the model using:
   - Accuracy score  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Cross-validation

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

## 📈 Results

- **Model Used**: Logistic Regression  
- **Validation Accuracy**: ~78%  
- **Key Features**: `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Title`, `Fare`

The model demonstrates solid performance for a baseline classification task and provides useful insights into the key factors influencing survival.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Implement additional classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost)  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`  
- Build a lightweight interface using **Flask** or **Streamlit**  
- Deploy the model using platforms like **Heroku** or **Render**
